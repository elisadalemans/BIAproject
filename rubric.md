## Analytics Overview (excellence):  

- Create and include a workflow diagram showing: 
- The overall predictive analytics process 
- Data loading/preprocessing steps (if applicable) 

## ML Implementation 
- Describe the selected features and, if applicable, the label column. 
- Describe the chosen ML algorithm(s) or the AutoML approach used. 

## Explain the use of hyperparameter tuning, including: (excellence) 
- What was tuned 
- Why it was important 

## If multiple algorithms were used: (excellence) 
- Provide a detailed description of how each was implemented 
- Or explain how AutoML selected models 

## ML Results 
- Summarize the results of the predictive analysis: 
- Accuracy 
- Performance metrics 
- Key findings/insights 
- Include tables or visualizations (e.g. confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.) to support results. 

## Ensure the Python scripts or Azure ML workflows are: (excellence) 
- Well-documented 
- Reproducible by others 

## ML Evaluation 
- Evaluate the performance of the model(s) in the context of: 
- Accuracy 
- Relevance to project objectives 

## Discuss the value of deployment: 
- What business or user value the deployed model will provide 

## Clearly justify the final model selection: (excellence): 
- Compare model performances
